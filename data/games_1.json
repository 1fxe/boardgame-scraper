      "description": "Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter five-round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power. Winning a bid on a given power plant allows that player to add it to their current inventory of power plants and also allows for more power to be made in a given turn. In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel. In both examples, bidding is done in a turn format and players have the option of passing on bids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMicrobadge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/microbadge/29034\"\u003e\u003cimg alt='Microbadge: Blind bidding fan' onmouseover=\"return overlib('Blind bidding fan', WRAP );\" onmouseout=\"return nd();\" title=''src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"onload=\"lzld(this)\"onerror=\"lzld(this)\"class='mbimg'data-frz-src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_29034_0.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/microbadge/29034\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;\"\u003eBlind bidding fan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n"

               "dataDescription": "\u003cp\u003eThis mechanic requires you to place a bid, usually monetary, on items in an auction of goods in order to enhance your position in the game. These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power. Winning a bid on a given power plant allows that player to add it to their current inventory of power plants and also allows for more power to be made in a given turn. In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel. In both examples, bidding is done in a turn format and players have the option of passing on bids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMicrobadge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/microbadge/29034\"\u003e\u003cimg alt='Microbadge: Blind bidding fan' onmouseover=\"return overlib('Blind bidding fan', WRAP );\" onmouseout=\"return nd();\" title=''src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"onload=\"lzld(this)\"onerror=\"lzld(this)\"class='mbimg'data-frz-src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_29034_0.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/microbadge/29034\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;\"\u003eBlind bidding fan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n"

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains.  All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2-for-1 for shares of the newer, larger business.  The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2-player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of \u0026quot;Vacations\u0026quot; from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called \u0026quot;ACQUIRE.\u0026quot; 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had taken liberties with some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;December 1963 - Test Market World Map Wood Tile Edition\u0026#10;1964 - Dated 1962/63 wood tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay \u0026amp; stocks with printed backs\u0026#10;1965 - Dated 1962/63 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay \u0026amp; stocks with printed backs (last edition made with printed backs until 1999)\u0026#10;1966 - Dated 1962/66 plastic tiles, chipboard with plastic overlay \u0026amp; non-wax coated stocks (Only edition with these stocks)\u0026#10;1968 - Dated 1968/66 plastic tiles, clear plastic board with paper underlay (Both 1966 inner box games have a lot of mixed parts)\u0026#10;1971 - Dated 1968/71 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board\u0026#10;1975 - 3M sells rights for game of ACQUIRE to the Avalon Hill Company\u0026#10;1976 - Dated 1976 plastic tiles, yellow hard plastic board, redesigned money, no inner box (This edition was also produced in 1977, 79, 81, 82,       \u0026amp; 86)\u0026#10;1989 - Dated 1976 Gray box edition with new box artwork same contents as regular 1976 editions (This edition was also produced in 1992)\u0026#10;1995 - Dated 1995 Large box cardboard edition with chipboard board and tiles, Special Powers Variant Tiles inspired by German editions\u0026#10;1997 - Avalon Hill sells the rights to the game of ACQUIRE to Hasbro\u0026#10;1999 - Dated 1999 Large box with large plastic board and tiles, 3D company buildings, redesigned stocks \u0026amp; money, large info cards\u0026#10;2006 - Hasbro assigns rights for the game of ACQUIRE to their subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast\u0026#10;2006 - Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE are made public, two major rule changes that help to bring the balance of the game of ACQUIRE back to the  intentions of Sid Sackson's original ideas \u0026#10;2008 - Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board \u0026amp; tiles, redesigned stocks \u0026amp; money\u0026#10;2016 - Dated 2016 The current affordable mass-market edition.

      "description": "Elfenland is a redesign of the original White Wind game Elfenroads.  The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\u0026#10;  \u0026#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck \u0026mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the \u0026quot;fields\u0026quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete \u0026mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player \u0026mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the \u0026quot;beanometer\u0026quot; for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power. Winning a bid on a given power plant allows that player to add it to their current inventory of power plants and also allows for more power to be made in a given turn. In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel. In both examples, bidding is done in a turn format and players have the option of passing on bids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMicrobadge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/microbadge/29034\"\u003e\u003cimg alt='Microbadge: Blind bidding fan' onmouseover=\"return overlib('Blind bidding fan', WRAP );\" onmouseout=\"return nd();\" title=''src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"onload=\"lzld(this)\"onerror=\"lzld(this)\"class='mbimg'data-frz-src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_29034_0.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/microbadge/29034\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;\"\u003eBlind bidding fan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n"

This system is also very efficient in board and cardgames, since it generates a high tension, and some anguish when rolling some more dice or drawing one more card. The best known \u0026ldquo;double or quits\u0026rdquo; game is probably Sid Sackson\u0026rsquo;s Can\u0026rsquo;t Stop, a clever dice game figuring, in the last edition, mountaineers so impatient to reach the summit that they usually end up falling down.

      "description": "In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities\u0026mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power.

In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel. In both examples, bidding is done in a turn format and players have the option of passing on bids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMicrobadge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/microbadge/29034\"\u003e\u003cimg alt='Microbadge: Blind bidding fan' onmouseover=\"return overlib('Blind bidding fan', WRAP );\" onmouseout=\"return nd();\" title=''src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"onload=\"lzld(this)\"onerror=\"lzld(this)\"class='mbimg'data-frz-src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_29034_0.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/microbadge/29034\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;\"\u003eBlind bidding fan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n"

The idea is not new. Many gambling games, such as Black Jack, make an intensive use of it, as well as some traditional dice game \u0026ndash; and Pass the Pigs is only a modern version of those. This system is also used in many TV games, where the winner can either leave with his gains, either answer one more question at the risk of losing everything he won so far. Like in Luigi Comencini\u0026rsquo;s Scopone Scientifico, if you never stop, you always end losing. This system is also very efficient in board and cardgames, since it generates a high tension, and some anguish when rolling some more dice or drawing one more card. The best known \u0026ldquo;double or quits\u0026rdquo; game is probably Sid Sackson\u0026rsquo;s Can\u0026rsquo;t Stop, a clever dice game figuring, in the last edition, mountaineers so impatient to reach the summit that they usually end up falling down.

They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's \u0026quot;registers\u0026quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;UPC 742818050029\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr\u0026uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair \u0026amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call \u0026quot;Wacky Water!\u0026quot; \u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: \u0026quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...\u0026quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.\u0026#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.\u0026#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 9\u0026#10;\u0026#10;See also the list of articles about Magic Realm in The General.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

The kingdoms of humans, elves, goblins, dwarves and trolls are pawns in the power games that absolute monarchs play. Ambassadors vie for the attention of the kings whose favor they curry. Assassination and backstabbing are popular pastimes, and loyal allies may leave your side in the heat of battle at the drop of a hat -- or a die.

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power. Winning a bid on a given power plant allows that player to add it to their current inventory of power plants and also allows for more power to be made in a given turn. In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel. In both examples, bidding is done in a turn format and players have the option of passing on bids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMicrobadge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/microbadge/29034\"\u003e\u003cimg alt='Microbadge: Blind bidding fan' onmouseover=\"return overlib('Blind bidding fan', WRAP );\" onmouseout=\"return nd();\" title=''src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"onload=\"lzld(this)\"onerror=\"lzld(this)\"class='mbimg'data-frz-src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_29034_0.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/microbadge/29034\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;\"\u003eBlind bidding fan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n"

The idea is not new. Many gambling games, such as Black Jack, make an intensive use of it, as well as some traditional dice game \u0026ndash; and Pass the Pigs is only a modern version of those. This system is also used in many TV games, where the winner can either leave with his gains, either answer one more question at the risk of losing everything he won so far. Like in Luigi Comencini\u0026rsquo;s Scopone Scientifico, if you never stop, you always end losing. This system is also very efficient in board and cardgames, since it generates a high tension, and some anguish when rolling some more dice or drawing one more card. The best known \u0026ldquo;double or quits\u0026rdquo; game is probably Sid Sackson\u0026rsquo;s Can\u0026rsquo;t Stop, a clever dice game figuring, in the last edition, mountaineers so impatient to reach the summit that they usually end up falling down. It\u0026rsquo;s even trickier when all players are aboard the same ship, not knowing if, or when, it will sink. Time to leave or not ? That\u0026rsquo;s what happen in Aaron Weissblum\u0026rsquo;s Cloud Nine, as well as in Diamant, a game I designed together with Alan R. Moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere's the introduction of the Jeopardy dice games from Reiner Knizia's \u003cem\u003eDice Games Properly Explained:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou focus on progessing and maximising your results.

More than ever, you need to weigh up the potential gains and losses. Rolling specific numbers or reaching certain totals may catch you out. You see disaster looming - but can you escape? Other games allow you to continue throwing as long as you keep your options open. Know when to stop and secure your results. If you get greedy and your luck fails, you are out. You need to make the right decisions and be lucky, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMicrobadge: \u003ca href=\"/microbadge/30837\"\u003e\u003cimg alt='Microbadge: Fan of Press-Your-Luck Games' onmouseover=\"return overlib('Fan of Press-Your-Luck Games', WRAP );\" onmouseout=\"return nd();\" title=''src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"onload=\"lzld(this)\"onerror=\"lzld(this)\"class='mbimg'data-frz-src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_30837_0.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e - \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/microbadge/30837\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;\"\u003eFan of Press-Your-Luck Games\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n"

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 \u0026amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 \u0026amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 \u0026amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn\u0026rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn\u0026rsquo;s progress lost.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

The idea is not new. Many gambling games, such as Black Jack, make an intensive use of it, as well as some traditional dice game \u0026ndash; and Pass the Pigs is only a modern version of those. This system is also used in many TV games, where the winner can either leave with his gains, either answer one more question at the risk of losing everything he won so far. Like in Luigi Comencini\u0026rsquo;s Scopone Scientifico, if you never stop, you always end losing. This system is also very efficient in board and cardgames, since it generates a high tension, and some anguish when rolling some more dice or drawing one more card. The best known \u0026ldquo;double or quits\u0026rdquo; game is probably Sid Sackson\u0026rsquo;s Can\u0026rsquo;t Stop, a clever dice game figuring, in the last edition, mountaineers so impatient to reach the summit that they usually end up falling down.

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris \u0026amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This \u0026quot;ziggurat expansion\u0026quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Some versions of Tigris \u0026amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

               "dataDescription": "\u003cp\u003eThis mechanic requires you to place a bid, usually monetary, on items in an auction of goods in order to enhance your position in the game. These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power. Winning a bid on a given power plant allows that player to add it to their current inventory of power plants and also allows for more power to be made in a given turn. In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel. In both examples, bidding is done in a turn format and players have the option of passing on bids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMicrobadge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/microbadge/29034\"\u003e\u003cimg alt='Microbadge: Blind bidding fan' onmouseover=\"return overlib('Blind bidding fan', WRAP );\" onmouseout=\"return nd();\" title=''src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"onload=\"lzld(this)\"onerror=\"lzld(this)\"class='mbimg'data-frz-src=\"https://cf.geekdo-static.com/mbs/mb_29034_0.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/microbadge/29034\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '_blank'); return false;\"\u003eBlind bidding fan\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n"

The idea is not new. Many gambling games, such as Black Jack, make an intensive use of it, as well as some traditional dice game \u0026ndash; and Pass the Pigs is only a modern version of those. This system is also used in many TV games, where the winner can either leave with his gains, either answer one more question at the risk of losing everything he won so far. Like in Luigi Comencini\u0026rsquo;s Scopone Scientifico, if you never stop, you always end losing. This system is also very efficient in board and cardgames, since it generates a high tension, and some anguish when rolling some more dice or drawing one more card. The best known \u0026ldquo;double or quits\u0026rdquo; game is probably Sid Sackson\u0026rsquo;s Can\u0026rsquo;t Stop, a clever dice game figuring, in the last edition, mountaineers so impatient to reach the summit that they usually end up falling down. It\u0026rsquo;s even trickier when all players are aboard the same ship, not knowing if, or when, it will sink. Time to leave or not ?

Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build the bishop's cathedral.  Finally, players harvest new resources for the next turn.  After all the pieces of the cathedral have been built, the game is over with the victory going to the player with the most victory points.

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power.

In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel.

      "description": "Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u0026ndash;10 in five different colors with three special \u0026quot;handshakes\u0026quot; (\u0026quot;HS\u0026quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, \u0026times;3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, \u0026times;2 for the multiplier.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

The idea is not new. Many gambling games, such as Black Jack, make an intensive use of it, as well as some traditional dice game \u0026ndash; and Pass the Pigs is only a modern version of those. This system is also used in many TV games, where the winner can either leave with his gains, either answer one more question at the risk of losing everything he won so far. Like in Luigi Comencini\u0026rsquo;s Scopone Scientifico, if you never stop, you always end losing. This system is also very efficient in board and cardgames, since it generates a high tension, and some anguish when rolling some more dice or drawing one more card. The best known \u0026ldquo;double or quits\u0026rdquo; game is probably Sid Sackson\u0026rsquo;s Can\u0026rsquo;t Stop, a clever dice game figuring, in the last edition, mountaineers so impatient to reach the summit that they usually end up falling down. It\u0026rsquo;s even trickier when all players are aboard the same ship, not knowing if, or when, it will sink. Time to leave or not ?

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power. Winning a bid on a given power plant allows that player to add it to their current inventory of power plants and also allows for more power to be made in a given turn. In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel.

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game.

In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel.

In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items.

In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value. Winning players pay for the room based on their bid and place it in their hotel.

Each player selects a combination of civilization tiles, which give his civilization special abilities or characteristics.  Players enlarge their empires through territorial expansion, often at the expense of other players.  The key to the game lies in choosing when to allow your active civilization to go into decline in order to select a new one that will generate more points.

Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons. All in all, 'twas a grand time!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game randomly lasts from 8 to 10 turns.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The winner is the player with the most Pretender Points.  \u0026#10;Points are gained at the end of each turn for each Province a player controls.  \u0026#10;Controlled cities gain revenue.

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game. This is similar to \u003ca  href=\"/boardgamemechanic/2082/worker-placement\"   \u003eWorker Placement\u003c/a\u003e, but workers can be kicked off spots by bidding higher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Power Grid, for example, you start with no power plants and must win bids to be able to produce power.

In Vegas Showdown, players bid on rooms. such as a slot machine or a restaurant, in order to build a larger hotel with more prestige and value.

      "description": "EastFront details the conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union during WWII.  Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and whether to try and break the other sides' lines.  Several scenarios cover every major point of the war.  The game comes with a fantastic, detailed map of Eastern Europe and Russia printed on cardstock and many wooden blocks for the units.  This is a standalone game that can also serve as one element of the complete EuroFront series which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This title uses the Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of the \u0026quot;Front\u0026quot; series of games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This accomplishes two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a \u0026quot;fog of war\u0026quot; because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.

It comes with a beautiful card-stock map from Vicksburg to Cincinnati and heaps of wooden blocks for the North and South.  The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Bobby Lee so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system.

This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a \u0026quot;fog of war\u0026quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it\u0026rsquo;s current strength.

It is a generic war game played on modular maps with World War II units.

Block sets for blue and red players and maps 1 to 4 are included in the base game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are many supplements available, including basic block sets for four additional colors (black, orange, green, and gray), ten-unit elite sets for each color, maps with various terrain, and a logistics expansion which provides a twist on production and adds other strategic elements to the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Expanded by:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War \u0026#226;\u0026#128;\u0026#147; Additional Blocksets\u0026#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War \u0026#226;\u0026#128;\u0026#147; Elite Blocksets\u0026#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War \u0026#226;\u0026#128;\u0026#147; Extra Maps\u0026#10;    Victory: The Blocks of War \u0026#226;\u0026#128;\u0026#147; Logistics Set\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Victory FAQ based on info in the rules forum here and elsewhere.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Reimplemented by:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Victory: World War II \u0026#226;\u0026#128;\u0026#147; Second Edition published in 2019.

We are all orphans of the Great War.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by six-time Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Components:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;     316 full-color die-cut counters:\u0026#10;         176 5/8\u0026rdquo; die cut counters\u0026#10;         140 1/2\u0026rdquo; die cut counters\u0026#10;    \u0026#10;     One 22x34\u0026quot; full-color mapsheet showing most of Europe and the Near East\u0026#10;     110 Strategy Cards\u0026#10;     32-page Rule Book including sample game replay (21 pages of actual rules)\u0026#10;     Two Player Reference Cards \u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;DESIGNER: Ted Raicer\u0026#10;DEVELOPER: Andy Lewis\u0026#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.

      "description": "In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;",

These goods allow players future actions or improve a position. The auction consists of taking turns placing bids on a given item until one winner is established, allowing the winner to take control of the item being bid on. Usually there is a game rule that helps drop the price of the items being bid on if no players are interested in the item at its current price. In most games, once a winner for one item is done, if there are more items to be bid upon, another auction is held for those items. The process repeats until a game condition is met or items are exhausted in the auction phase of the game.

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea.  There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another.  In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play.  Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain.  Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The components for the game are quite elaborate.  Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts.  Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain.  Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games.
